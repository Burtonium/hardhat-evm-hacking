# Modifying EVM Storage to Seed Token Balances inÂ Testing

Welcome to my GitHub repository for my comprehensive guide on direct EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) storage manipulation to streamline smart contract testing. This repository serves as a practical extension to my Medium article of the same title as above. Here, I showcase mildly advanced techniques that allow developers to interact directly with the EVM's storage layer, enabling more efficient and targeted testing processes.

## Hands-on Challenge

For those who are eager to test their skills and implement EVM storage manipulation functions themselves, I encourage you to check out the `solve-yourself` branch. This branch has a failing test case allowing you to apply the concepts and techniques discussed without direct guidance.

```console
git checkout solve-yourself
```
